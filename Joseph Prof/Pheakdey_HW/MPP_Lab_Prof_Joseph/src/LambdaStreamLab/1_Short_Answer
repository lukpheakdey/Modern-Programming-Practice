a. 	- Functional Programming 
		+ is declarative, which makes it possible to write methods and program by declaring "what" is needed.
	- Imperative Programming 
		+ is procedural, it tells "how" the program suppose to run using the sequence of function calls that mirrors the requirements.


b.	Explain the meaning of declarative programming. Give an example.
declarative programming means that it tells the method/program what is needed rather that how to achieve a goal. 
It is realized as we use it in functional programming which consume functional interface consisting of only one abstract method. 
For instance lamda, which is a realization of functional interface.


c.	Name the benefits of including functional style programming in Java
Functional programming in Java makes it possible to write parts of Java programs more concisely, in a more readable way, in a more thread safe way, in a more parallelizable way, and in a more maintainable way, than ever before.
